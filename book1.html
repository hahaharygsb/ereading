                <h1>The Golden Touch: The Story of King Midas</h1> 
            <pre class="jtp"> 
            Midas was a <a href="WordDefinition.html#Powerful" target="_blank" >powerful</a>, yet greedy man. 
            He spent his days counting his gold and at night he dreamed of great riches. 
            No matter how much gold he received, it was never enough. 
            One day King Midas was out in his beautiful rose garden 
            when he met a satyr- half man, half goat.   
                    
            The satyr was lost, so King Midas gave him some food and 
            directed him back to the right path. 
            The satyr was very grateful to the king for his assistance. 
            He wanted to reward Midas by granting him one wish.
            King Midas thought long and hard. 
            How could one wish to fulfill his many wants? 
                    
            In fact, Midas felt a little cheated because he knew three wishes were the standard reward. 
            He was just about to voice this very <a href="WordDefinition.html#Sentiment" target="_blank">sentiment</a> to the satyr when suddenly he had a brilliant idea. 
            Visions of money, wealth, and treasure <a href="WordDefinition.html#Filled" target="_blank">filled</a> his mind.
            "Gold!" shouted the King 
                    
            "I want everything that I touch to turn to gold!"
                    
            "Oh, I don't think that is a good idea," said the satyr 
                    
            "You should reconsider your request."
                    
            But Midas insisted and the satyr granted the wish.
            Midas could not wait to test out his new gift. 
                    
            He reached down and picked up a rock. 
            As his eyes widened in <a href="WordDefinition.html#Disbelief" target="_blank">disbelief</a>, the rock became solid gold. 
            The king was thrilled and 
            began touching everything in sight- grass, leaves, acorns, flowers, 
            and tree branches I have the golden touch, he thought.
            He raced through the forest the king was finally happy. 
            He would be the <a href="WordDefinition.html#Richest"target="_blank" >richest</a> man in the world.
                    
            Back at the castle, King Midas <a href="WordDefinition.html#Demanded"target="_blank" >demanded</a> a huge celebration <a href="WordDefinition.html#Feast" target="_blank">feast</a>. 
            He wanted meats, fruits, cheeses, and slices of bread. 
            Nothing but the best would do for the king now that he was going to be rich!
            As he sat down to eat, the chair turned to gold at his touch He reached for a drink 
            and the cup turned into a <a href="WordDefinition.html#Golden"target="_blank" >golden</a> <a href="WordDefinition.html#Goblet"target="_blank" >goblet</a> in his hand. 
            Midas went to take a sip of the water but suddenly <a href="WordDefinition.html#Choked" target="_blank">choked</a> on a lump of gold. 
            He grabbed a piece of bread, and bit into it. It, too, turned to gold.
                    
            "Oh, no!" cried the king "I will starve to death."
    
            At her father's cry, the king's young daughter rushed to console her father. 
            As she wrapped her arms around her father, she quickly turned into a golden statue.
            Sobbing, Midas fell to his knees and <a href="WordDefinition.html#Begged"target="_blank">begged</a> the gods to set him free of his <a href="WordDefinition.html#Foolish">foolish</a> wish. 
                    
            His tears became tiny golden marbles as he cried.
                    
            "I have learned my lesson! My wish was foolish and now I am being punished for it. 
            I have learned that money can't buy happiness.
    
            "Family is more important". 
    
            Please take all the gold and let things return to the way they were," begged the king.
                
            The gods took <a href="WordDefinition.html#Pity" target="_blank">pity</a> on the king. 
            He was <a href="WordDefinition.html#Instructed" target="_blank">instructed</a> to go to the river 
            Pactolus to wash his entire body and remove 
            the Midas touch-which was a curse rather than a gift.
                    
            King Midas raced to the river and <a href="WordDefinition.html#Scrubbed" target="_blank">scrubbed</a> himself. 
            He could see flecks of gold <a href="WordDefinition.html#Floating" target="_blank">floating</a> in the water. 
            When he stepped out of the river, 
                    
            his power was gone, and his daughter had sprung back to life.
            King Midas realized that he was not truly happy. 
            However, the gods gave King Midas a reminder of his foolishness. 
            Two donkey ears <a href="WordDefinition.html#Sprouted" target="_blank">sprouted</a> from the top of his head, and Midas never forgot his lesson.
